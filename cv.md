My target is to become a successful person in the field of employment and, in my opinion, there are several criteria for success. Firstly, this is a effective work that requires you to have sufficient intellectual efforts. In the second - a pleasant atmosphere in the work team. Thirdly, good pay for your work with the prospect of growth. Based on the above requirements, I decided to devote myself to learning Javascript. No doubt, many difficulties await me on this way, but I am ready to work more hardy to overcoming them. My character is strong enough to complete what I had planned in spite of any difficulties. Yes, now my candidaty for the employer does not look attractive enough, but I am ready to convince each of them, that 13 years in the army is enough to develop a solid character, ready to set any goals for himself and achieve them at any cost.

I know how to work with HTML, CSS, JS codes. And ready for the most basic layout of sites in VS code. I have enow knowledge of the Git, its interaction with the GitHub resource and version control.

I knw? how to work with functions, arrays, cicles, recursive functions: let array = []; function gen(step, number){ for (let i = 0; i < number; i = i + step){ console.log(i); array.push(i); } console.log(step, number); } gen(2, 5); console.log(array);

Until the present courses in the Rolling Scopes Scool, I had no experience in programming. These courses are the first work in a new direction.

My practice of English is very limited only shool and universety program and I nave not any practic for 8 years. But the level of knowledge of English is A2 level!
